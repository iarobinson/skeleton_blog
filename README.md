# What this is

This is a blog CMS to practice my Ruby on Rails skills.

I'm followin along with a [YouTube tutorial linked here](https://youtu.be/wbZ6yrVxScM). The code developed for the [tutorial can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/justalever/demo_blog_rails) as well.

When doing tutorials, I like to differentiate the project slightly. I believe that helps me internalize the tutorial at a deeper level. To do that here, I'll be building a Rails blog with a CSS framework called Skeleton, rather than Bootstrap.
